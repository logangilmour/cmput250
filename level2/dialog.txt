=== Meet Kid ===
Little Girl: Hi!

Deckard: Hey kid. Where's your mommy?

Little Girl: My mommy's sleeping! She was reading me my favourite book, but now she's sleeping. I hope she wakes up soon and finishes reading to me.

Deckard: What's your favourite book?

Little Girl: Oh the Places You'll Go! It's by Dr. Seuss.

Deckard: That's a good book, kid. Let's find your mommy.

Little Girl: OK!
