=== Meet Kid ===
Little Girl: 
Hi!

Deckard: 
Hey kid. Where's your mommy?

Little Girl: 
My mommy's sleeping! She was reading me my favourite book, but now she's sleeping. I hope she wakes up soon and finishes reading.

Deckard: 
What's your favourite book?

Little Girl: 
Oh the Places You'll Go! It's by Dr. Seuss.

Deckard: 
That's a good book, kid. Let's find your mommy.

Little Girl: 
OK!

=== Kid 2 ===
Little Girl: 
My book! Will you read it to me? Pleeeease?

Deckard: 
Sorry kid. No time. You know about the big computer where all of the memories live?

Little Girl:
Yeah! Big Sis' is going there today. She's going to get rid of mommy's nightmares!

Deckard:
Sounds good kid. Anyway, It's my job to take care of that computer, and it's broken. I think that's why your mommy here is all froze up.

Little Girl:
Oh, OK. Mommy does this all the time though. Is the computer broken all the time?

Deckard:
I don't know, kid. Anyway, I'm going to try to help her.

=== The Mom ===

Mom:
Strange... I... I was just about to...

Deckard:
I found your kid wandering around in the street.

Mom: 
Oh... Hey baby!

Deckard:
You should probably... Never mind. I can tell I'm wasting my breath here. You know how I can get through to the city centre?

Mom:
I... I don't... remember...

Deckard:
Please try to remember. I think something very bad is happening.

Mom:
You could try my uh... supplier... I think he goes there sometimes... he's just over there. Hmm... you look familiar..."

Deckard:
Alright, thanks.

=== Jensen ===
Jensen:
Deckard! You almost here?

Deckard:
Take it easy, man. I'm coming as fast as I can. Seems like this shit's been affecting the whole city - everyone I've seen so far has been in a fragment loop. Something's seriously corrupted.

Jensen:
Shit. That's not good. I'm still trapped. I've been looking through the camera feeds. Some woman's set up at one of the side-entrances, trying to get in. Doesn't look like anyone I know. Everyone else is just... standing still.

Deckard:
Probably all in fragment loops. Wonder why your door woman isn't.

Jensen:
I don't know, man. I've got a bad feeling. Hurry up.

Deckard:
I'm hurrying.

=== Dealer ===
Dealer:
Wha... What's up, man?

Deckard:
You know a way to city centre without going through the checkpoint?

Dealer:
Yeah man... but why should I tell you? You look like some kind of cop.

Deckard:
I've got bigger problems than your illegal memory smuggling, buddy. If I can't get through, though, I won't have much to do. And I like having something to do. Hauling your ass in - that's something to do.

Dealer:
OK, OK, I get the picture. Here. Just head through this hatch, down a tunnel, and then up through the next hatch you find.

Deckard:
Thanks buddy. Try not to ruin to many lives.

Dealer:
Hey man, I just give people what they want.
